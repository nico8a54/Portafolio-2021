                <p>Through all these years, I've developed cross-disciplinary skills that let me approach different types of projects in a very strategic fashion.
                    Coming from an Industrial Design background based on rigorous, in-depth research, I have evolved to a holistic design approach with a strong emphasis on UX / UI solutions.<br><br>
                    During my career, I've been able to work and lead different projects that had helped international brands such as John Deere, Perking Elmer, and Corona, among others. I've also built a highly efficient, multitalented team that will bring any challenging project to life.<br><br>
                    The work that I´ve led has been granted eleven Global recognitions from the most prestigious International Awards such as "Red Dot design award", "IF design award", "A´Design Award", and "Good Design Award", among others.</p>
