                    <p>Over the past 6+ years, I've led the strategic design transformation for the "Organización Corona."
                    I've put together a high-performance and multi-talented team responsible for the company's Pan American portfolio creation. <br><br>                        
                    The Corona Design Team has become a referent around the creative community in the region, and we are expanding our capabilities.</p>

            <p>
                Back in 2014, Corona committed to transforming its portfolio strategy and its mindset about innovation through design. I got hired to establish the company's design area from scratch. <br><br>
                With the experience acquired working with international designers and brands, I brought and adapted a Design process that helped our team shine and succeeds. This process is base on three main pillars: Research, Ideation, and Engineering.

            <p class="spacer64">
                Design thinking is the core of our process. Everything starts with in-depth user needs research, a market trend analysis, and a benchmark study. We also do group meetings to discuss opportunities for each project.
            </p>            
            
            <div class="grid threeColumns spacer64">  <!-- Grid 3 columns -->    
                <div class="imageMetodoly imageMetodoly1"></div>
                <div class="imageMetodoly imageMetodoly2"></div>
                <div class="imageMetodoly imageMetodoly3"></div>
            </div>

            <p class="spacer64">
                After finding the insights from research, we define the Design Directions, which becomes the framework for our ideation phase. In "ideation," we commit to creating ideas around those Design Directions; every single concept must solve or has to be connected with an insight.<br><br>

                On ideation, we use a funnel system to synthesize ideas, starting from a phase called “ideation 16”, in which every designer must sketch a minimum of 16 loose concepts. Because this is a fast-paced exercise, the quality of the sketches isn’t that important; what matters here is the quality of the concepts. To finish “ideation 16”, the group gather to discuss and select four ideas. Each of these ideas will go through a refinement exercise until we can move to what we call “ideation 4.” <br> <br>
                
                “Ideation 4,” as its name says, is a presentation of 4 concepts shown with high fidelity hand sketches. The objective of this activity is to meet with the marketing team to discuss and select two designs. Knowing that we will throw away 50% of the work, we need to be very efficient, and that is why we won’t do CAD, in this phase.  <br> <br>

                Once we’ve selected two concepts, it’s time to move to “Ideation 2”. Here is where things become real. We create CAD models, mockups, 3d prototypes, photorealistic renders, animations, and every single action needed to make the most outstanding presentation. Then, we gather with the board to present both concepts and select the final one. After this then we move to the development phase.
