                The History of this project started with the marketing team's goal of growing 37% of the market share for toilet seats while keeping a profit margin of 60%. That's where we got committed to work whit them finding ideas that will help us achieve this goal. <br><br>
                The first thing that came to our minds was to understand the buying process for toilet seats. Understand why there was an unproportionate difference in sales between toilets and toilet seats. <br><br>

                Because Design thinking is the core of our process, we used these methodologies for user and market research.           
                The results of this research were stounding. We found there was a lot to do in terms of communicating and facilitating the seat-changing process. They showed us massive opportunities from the final user standpoint.

                The process involved a lot of preparation prior to execution. We planned research, ideation, prototyping, and execution. Every detail was perfectly crafted. <br><br>
                We used Miro and Figma to create a variety of mockups for testing and refinement. Once we felt comfortable with the prototypes, we ran several rounds of UX validation with real users. The result of that study helped us simplified the final product. <br><br>
                The main technology behind tuasiento.corona.co is a Machine Leraning model that identify the user toilet, base on a database of us. We as the design team got to integrate this technology with a custom made interface that we designed based on our research.
                The final product was created in React JS and hosted in AWS. It communicates with the AI machine via API Rest. The library of products was built in Graph CMS and called via API Rest as well. All this architecture followed Corona’s IT requirements.
                We are in trial mode, preparing for launch in October 2021. We set up a Google tag manager to track the performance on our web app and collect data to measure the rate of conversion for this tool.
